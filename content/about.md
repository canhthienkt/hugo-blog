## About

I'm a software developer at [Tyson Foods](https://www.tysonfoods.com/technology-careers) where we work on AI/machine learning solutions that digitally transform Tyson. 

I graduated from [Texas A&M university](https://www.tamu.edu/) with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering. 

My background includes full-stack development, devops, and machine learning/mlops. My tech stack varies: 
* For web development: Typescript, React, Vite, 
* For devops: Docker, EKS(Kubernetes), and Terraform
* For backend development and machine learning: Python

## What to look for in this blog

I will be writing about my side projects that I work on and reflect on things that I learn along the way (technical and non-technical).

Also, this blog is a way to keep myself accountable for 17 to-do lists of things that I want to work on. Hope you will enjoy them. ðŸ™‚
